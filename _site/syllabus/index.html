  This is a brief syllabus for Introduction to Computing
</p>

<h1 id="course-overview">Course overview</h1>

<p>The goal of this course is to introduce you to a wide variety of concepts and tools in computer science. Each of the topics covered below could easily be a course in their own right. You will likely not be proficient at any one by the time the course is over. The main purpose of this course is to give you a sense for the <em>core concepts</em> underlying the various topics, so that you can develop mastery over time, as needed for your own research. In this spirit, much of the course is self-taught. We will provide you links to carefully chosen materials from around the web, a venue for discussion, and also help when you need it. You bring your brain and problem-solving abilities. Also, your search engine is your friend here.</p>

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>

<p>This course is graded pass/fail. You’ll need to submit 80% of the homework correctly to pass.</p>

<h1 id="what-happens-in-class">What happens in class</h1>

<p>We will discuss solutions from last week’s homework and introduce concepts that were not sufficiently well clarified in the web resources we dug up.</p>

<h1 id="instructors">Instructors</h1>

<p>Sasha (faculty) and Valentin (TA). For techincal questions turn to the web first, your classmates third, and to Valentin fourth. To facilitate communication, we’ve created a <a href="http://computing-team.slack.com">course team on Slack</a>. You will receive an invitation.</p>
