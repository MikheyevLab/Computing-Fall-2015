## Installing a Linux Virtual Machine (VM)

If you have Linux running on your laptop you don't need to follow this step. You are already a pro. Otherwise follow [these instructions](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox). They are for Windows, but should work similarly on the Mac.

You can then make your way to the [command line](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal), where the real fun begins.

## Navigating the command line

Here are a number of useful links:
- This [tutorial from the University of Surrey](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) is a good introduction. Read up to chapter 4, and leave the rest for later.
- [An Introduction to Linux Virtual Workshop](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/Linux/default). This tutorial is slightly

### More advanced tutorials
These might be overkill to start with, but we list them here as references you may want to check out later.
- [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php). Very comprehensive into, though perhaps a bit dense.
- [A Practical Guide to Linux Commands Editors and Shell Programming](http://www.aem.umn.edu/~aem3100/spring2013/Prentice_Hall_A_Practical_Guide_to_Linux_Commands_Editors_and_Shell_Programming_2nd.pdf
). This is an actual book, covering a lot of different topics.
- [Shell workshop](http://www.pehjota.net/guides/shell-workshop/) A series of slides and code examples for how to use the shell. Perhaps a bit dry, but very useful.
- [Basic Linux Navigation and File Management](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/basic-linux-navigation-and-file-management). More general and basic
- [Linux Driverâ€™s Ed](http://www.physics.smu.edu/coan/linux/index.html) **Goal:** To transform an intelligent, motivated person with zero linux experience into a capable linux user without inducing tears, drawing blood or triggering frustration-fueled outbursts of profanity.

## Install python

There are Ubuntu-specific instructions provided in [this form answer](http://askubuntu.com/questions/244544/how-do-i-install-python-3-3). You will get a lot of your most useful information from forum answers like this one. Follow these instructions up to ```make && sudo make install```

You can then use ```pip```, which comes with Python to [install IPython](http://ipython.org/install.html), an interactive environment you can use for playing around (```pip install "ipython[notebook]"```). You can then play around with the awesome [ipython notebook computational environment](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). We also have a [public server](http://ipython.oist.jp:8888). Don't keep any files on the public server though, it will periodically be purged.

# Homework

These are exercises to be finished by next week's class. (for Valentin to complete)

1. These are the most important linux commands you should know for sure. Describe what each one does in your own words
  - ```ls```
  - ```cd```
  - ```mkdir```
  - ```cp```
  - ```rm```
  - ```ln```
  - ```cat```
  - ```less```
2. Which shortcuts refer to (a) the current directory (b) to the directory above the current one (c) the home folder?
3. What is the difference between a folder and a directory?
4. How do you remove an empty directory? What if it is not empty? Give examples.
