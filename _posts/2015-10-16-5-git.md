# Homework

The homework is due on *October 22 2015* at *13:00pm* (eg. noon).

Create a fork of the repository `MikheyevLab/Exercise5` and create a series of commit to solve the exercises below. For each part of the exercise there should be *at least* one commit, preferably more than one.

Each commit should explain your thought process (and resources used) in the commit messages and the code to solve the exercise.

0. Create a Github account and configure git.
1. Fork the repository `MikheyevLab/Exercise5`.
2. Implement a data-structure that realizes an undirected graph.
  - Read up on directed and undirected graphs.
  - Read up on adjacency lists and matrices and decide on which to use.
  - Implement a function that creates a fully connected graph.
  - Implement a function that creates a randomly connected graph.
  - Implement the small-world initialization algorithm.
  - Implement an algorithm that determines if your graph is cycle free.
  - Extend your graph to store values along the edges (weights) and randomly assign them.
  - Implement an algorithm that tries to greedily find the cheapest route from A->B (interpreting weights as costs).
