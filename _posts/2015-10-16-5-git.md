# Collaboration
Science is based on collaboration and in our ever more interconnected world this collaboration happens around the globe in several time zones. Managing these collaborations can be time consuming, especially if it involves creating a manuscript or software together. The most straight-forward way of doing this is to send your collaborator a copy of your manuscript and ask for feedback. A few hours/days later she will look at it and add comments or correct paragraphs. The same holds true for software. After she gets back to you, you will now have to incorporate those changes into your local copy. But in the time it took your collaborator to get back to you, you probably already made changes to the manuscript.
Such a workflow creates inefficiencies and you will spend a lot of time managing different edits, especially when the number of collaborators increases.
One possible way out of this is to use an online platform like Google Docs to enable live and real-time collaboration, but that is infeasible for source code.

The open-source community has developed several tools for handling these problems and one particular one came out of the development of the Linux kernel and enables hundreds of developers to simultaneously develop one piece of source code.

# Git model
Git is a decentralized
  - Repositories
  - Remotes
  - Commits

It also solves the problem of keeping track of prior versions and when changes where introduced. As an example this set of [lecture notes is kept as a git repository](https://github.com/MikheyevLab/Computing-Fall-2015/tree/gh-pages).

# Homework
The homework is due on *October 22 2015* at *13:00pm* (eg. noon).

Create a fork of the repository `MikheyevLab/Exercise5` and create a series of commit to solve the exercises below. For each part of the exercise there should be *at least* one commit, preferably more than one.

Each commit should explain your thought process (and resources used) in the commit messages and the code to solve the exercise.

0. Create a Github account and configure git.
1. Fork the repository `MikheyevLab/Exercise5`.
2. Implement a data-structure that realizes an undirected graph.
  - Read up on directed and undirected graphs.
  - Read up on adjacency lists and matrices and decide on which to use.
  - Implement a function that creates a fully connected graph.
  - Implement a function that creates a randomly connected graph.
  - Implement the small-world initialization algorithm.
  - Implement an algorithm that determines if your graph is cycle free.
  - Extend your graph to store values along the edges (weights) and randomly assign them.
  - Implement an algorithm that tries to greedily find the cheapest route from A->B (interpreting weights as costs).
