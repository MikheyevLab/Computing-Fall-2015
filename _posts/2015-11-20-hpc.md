# High performance computing on OIST infrastructure
Science is more and more moving towards problem that involve data sizes that are only solvable with HPC. HPC stands for computing that occur on networked cluster of machines or on so called supercomputers. OIST currently operates two cluster Sango and Tombo (going to be phased out).

## Concepts
A cluster consists of several independent computers (called nodes) that are connected over a very fast network. Each node contains several CPUs (processors) that are clustered in NUMAs. Each cluster of CPUs share memory, but they also can access memory in othe NUMA groups. Communication between CPUs in a node is fast and communication between nodes is relatively slow, in a setting where computation is distributed across several nodes, communication can become a bottleneck.

There are two main paradigms of parallel computation, shared-memory and message passing. In the shared-memory paradigm every process has access to the same memory and can read and write to it at any point in time, access to critical regions has to be regulated by programming constructs like mutexes. The message passing model is based around the idea that each process has its own memory and necessary information are passed around via message and synchronizations of the computation happens only during the communication step. Shared memory programs are most of the time easier to write, but they can only run on *one* node, since the basic assumption is that memory access is cheap. Reasoning about message-passing programs can be harder, but computations can span thousands of nodes. 

Sidestepping that issue are embarrassingly parallel problems, where no communication is necessary between processes. As an example performing 10000 stochastic simulation at once.

Lastly in modern supercomputers accelerator cards are available. Accelerator cards are as an example GPUs, that contain small processing units that can compute vectorizable problems in lock-step.
