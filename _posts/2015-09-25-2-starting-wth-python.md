# Homework
The homework is due on *October 1 2015* at *7:30am*.

1. What is a function? Describe in your own words.
2. What is a class? Describe in your own words.
3. Transform the following for loop into an equivalent while loop.
4. What are atomic data-structures and why are they special?
5. What is a list? In other programming languages you might encounter the term array, is there any difference to a list in python?
6. Implement a binary tree in python (assume that element types are integers).
7. How would you test that your implementation is correct?
8. What might the be the benefits of a tree as opposed to a list. Think about searching and sorting entries. (No worries if you don't know what to write down here. We are going to talk about this in two weeks in more detail.)
